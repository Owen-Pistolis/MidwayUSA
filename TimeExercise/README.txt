I chose to use Node JS for this.  To run it, make sure that you have Node and consequently NPM (Node Package Manager) installed, you can do 
it at this link if you don't: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.  After that is done, open a terminal at this folder and do an npm install,
this will install any required dependencies.  After that, in the terminal simply enter node <filename> to run the file.
